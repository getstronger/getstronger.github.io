Although I’d been a member of a gym a few different times in my life, I would never have considered myself athletic or fit. But, I was turning 40 and decided it was now or never and once again joined my local gym. However, this time was different. I hired a personal trainer. Knowing that I had to instill the discipline and routine to stay active beyond a few months, having a personal trainer gave me with the incentive to get to the gym, while providing me with a safe and effective program to meet my personal goals. After working out with a trainer off and on for nearly two years and seeing and feeling the results of living a fit lifestyle, I wanted to help others the way my trainer had helped me and pursued my personal trainer certification.

After completing a health assessment, I’ll customize a program to meet your goals and needs and we’ll work together to get you where YOU want to be. So, why wait?
